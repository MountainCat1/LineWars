## 2. Gameplay Mechanics
### 2.1 Core Mechanics

##### Tug of War
The main objective is to survive as long as possible. The enemies will spawn on the other side of the map and will try to destroy your base. You will have to defend your base.
All units except for the hero automatically move along the path of the line, attack enemies, and use abilities.

##### Building Upgrading System
Each "unit building" can be upgraded to spawn stronger units, in a way that each building has a unique upgrade path.
For example from archer you can get a sniper or crossbowman, from crossbowman you can get a ballista or a catapult, from catapult you can get a trebuchet or a cannon, etc.

##### Jungle aka Creep aka Neutral Buildings and Units
Outside the main lanes there are neutral units and buildings that can be killed/destroyed to get bonus gold, xp as well as items for heroes.

##### Heroes
Each player has a hero that can be directly controlled to attack enemy units and buildings.
Each hero has levels and abilities that can be upgraded. As well as items that can be bought or found.


### 2.2 Objectives and Goals
##### Base game aka coop/single mode
Players builds his base to produce enough units to defend against constant attacks from the other side of the line.
Players need to invest part of their money into the economy to not fall behind.
Players need to utilize their heroes to help the units on a lane, attack the jungle to get additional xp, items and gold.
Spontaneously players will encounter random events that will make the game random and more interesting
Once every some units the boss wave will appear testing player's defenses.

##### PvP
The same as coop, but instead of fighting spawning enemies you need to combat the other player on the other side of the lane.
